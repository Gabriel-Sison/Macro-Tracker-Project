I've always had a passion for fitness. Growing up, I've always struggled with my weight, yo-yo dieted every few months, and was overall unhappy 
with the way I looked. But then, after getting into the world of bodybuilding, I figured out what I needed to do to achieve my goals. Losing fat is 
simple, eat less calories than your body consumes. If you want to lose 1 pound a week, aim to eat 500 calories below your maintenance calories a day. 
Most men need to consume 2500 calories a day to maintain their weight, and most women need to consume 2000. If you incorporate exercise into your daily 
life, you can add 200-300 calories to your maintenance calories. Incorporating strength training and progressive overload into your life will also help 
you gain muscle, which is more metabolically active than fat. This means that a pound of muscle will burn more calories for simply existing than a pound 
of fat. Getting into bodybuilding made me realize that at the end of the day, your weight on the scale matters less than your body composition. Two people 
can be the exact same weight, but if one is carrying mostly fat, and the other has a significant amount of lean muscle mass, then they will look completely 
different from each other. Bodybuilding made me realize that I should prioritize my nutrition and exercise routine over the number I see on the scale.

I want to help make it easier for people to stick to their fitness goals. Tracking your calories, macronutrients, workouts, and weight can be very 
overwhelming, especially for beginners. Linked below is a tool I've been using since February 2022 that has helped me do all of the above. I've lost 
25 pounds so far, have been increasing the weights I've been lifting at the gym, and have been eating whatever food I've wanted as long as it fits into 
my macros.

Your fitness goals shouldn't feel out of reach. Feel free to copy the link above and use it for your personal goals!
